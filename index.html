            <p> Im Hannah, I am 20 years old, I grew up in Auckland and moved to Wellington in 2019 to study.<br>
            I study Design for Social Innovation, I was intrested in this degree as I knew I wanted to persue something creative
            after high school and after taking first year design this was the option that most apealed to me, 
            as it has a good mixture of my interests and where I would like to see myself in a few years. <br> This was my
            first experience coding in this paper and although I found it very challenging, it was enjoyable and rewarding. <br>
